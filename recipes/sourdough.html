        <h2>Whats not to get excited about this fresh, chewy, gut healthy sourdough boule?</h2>

                <h3><strong>Sourdough Boule Ingredients:</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active sourdough starter</strong>: The starter should have been fed 4-12 hours before starting the dough. Usually bubbling and doubled in size.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtered or boiled water</strong>: Filtered is best. Alternatively, boiling for 15-20 mins diffuses the chlorine of tap water. Or leaving a jug at room temperature for 24 hours will have the same effect. </li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Always try to opt for sea salt or himalayan salt. Iodized or table salt may alter the taste.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic strong bread flour</strong>: Organic flours are always a better option if you have access.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3><Strong>Tools you may need:</Strong></h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Banneton or bowl lined with a tea towel.</li>
                <li>Dutch oven preferably.</li>
                <li>Large glass bowl</li>

                <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add dry ingredients to a large bowl. Add in the sourdough starter and water. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Cover and let the dough rest for 15-30 minutes.</li>
                <LI>Grab the edge of the dough and pull up stretching it out as you pull upwards.</LI>
				<li>Place dough that is in your hands back into the center. Turn the bowl about a quarter turn and complete another stretch and fold. Repeat the stretching and folding two more times. Cover.</li>
				<li>First 3 stretch and folds – every 15 minutes.Last 3 stretch and folds – every 30 minutes.</li>
				<li>Cover with damp cloth or cling film</li>

				<h3><strong>Bulk fermentation</strong></h3>

				<li>Place dough in large, oiled bowl and cover with cling film or airtight lid.</li>
				<li>Allow to ferment for 8-12 hours. At least double in size. the longer the fermentation, the more acidity is created giving that signature sourdough flavour! so if you love that, then ferement longer.</li>

<h3><strong>Shaping the boule</strong></h3>

				<li>The next morning, take dough from the bowl, on a lightly  floured surface. Shape into a round with oiled or floured hands. Pull each edge in to the middle until all have been folded to create tension. Leave to stand for 5 mins.</li>
				<li>Place the dough in a basket seam side up.</li>
				<li>Allow to rise for a second time until doubled, 2 to 4 hours.</li>
				<li>Preheat oven to 220degrees c. </li>
				<LI>Score the boule into any design.</LI>
				<li>put transfer to parchment paper and place in Dutch oven.</li>
				<li>Add a little sprayed water for that crunchy texture.</li>
				<li>Bake for 30 mins with the lid on, remove the lid and bake for a further 20 mins or until golden brown.</li>
